= asciidoctor-test-webapp

A very basic test web app to check if Asciidoctor works inside a container

This project builds a war file that can be deployed to a Java EE server.
To build the war just call

----
./gradlew war
----

You will find the resulting war in `build/libs/asciidoctortest.war`.

Deploy the application to your application server and go to http://localhost:8080/asciidoctortest/asciidoctor?user=World[].

If everything is ok you should see a page containing the text _Hello World!_.
The header is always _Hello World_ while the content changes with the `user` parameter you pass to the page.
